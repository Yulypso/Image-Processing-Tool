## Introduction 

This project is about creating a tool that reads an image in a given format (bitmap or jpeg), process this image (enlarge, shrink ...), save the image in an output file different from the one given as input ( same format as input or different) to never corrupt the original files.

## Get Started

```bash
#To run: 
> python3 lecture_BMP.py --bmp images/<IMAGE>
```
